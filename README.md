Hello there! My name is Abdullahi and I'm a full-stack engineer at Univelcity. I built [Zazzani AI](https://zazzani.com), a groundbreaking multimodal AI tool that empowers entrepreneurs to build minimum viable products (MVPs) by integrating various AI models into a single user interface. The project was an instant hit, attracting hundreds of users, including a number of YC founders.
