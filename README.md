Hello there! My name is Abdullahi and I'm a full-stack developer at Univelcity where I create pixel-perfect frontend solutions with my favourite tools in the React ecosystem and optimise business logic on the backend for our customers. 

I'm a [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) grad and a serial hackathon winner. I created [App Video Chat](https://collaboration-video-app.netlify.app), a video call application feature for [Recursive](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFPMoHye9w/jM91bHXy9ObSrr84Wf73Ow/view?utm_content=DAFPMoHye9w&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=homepage_design_menu#5), a startup solving some of the toughest problems in the edtech space.  

## Meta
* Currently reading — Cracking the Coding Interview
* Currently writing — [Recursive](https://abdullahifahm.hashnode.dev), (yes :joy:),my Hashnode blog.

* Wanna reach out? I'm on Twitter as `@zzinedddine` and in the mailspace as [abdullahifahm@gmail.com](mailto:abdullahifahm@gmail.com)
